Plain vanilla ice cream (you can use a regular ice cream or coffee flavored ice cream. I used a coconut based dairy free vanilla ice cream, because I can’t tolerate dairy).
Coffee or espresso, cold (or use instant coffee and milk instead).
Cream (optional) to cut some sugar and reduce the amount of ice cream. I used coconut cream, which is dairy free, but it’s up to you.
Frozen banana (for a thicker milkshake, or use ice).
Cacao powder (the chocolate flavor will enhance the coffee flavor even more).
Pinch of cinnamon (the spice hint will make it even more flavorful).
