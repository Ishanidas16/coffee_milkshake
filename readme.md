This is my coffee flavoured milkshake with expresso.

The strong espresso sure will give you the jolt you need on a slow afternoon. And this rich espresso milkshake is for true coffee lovers, it will burst with coffee (mocha) flavor!

If you donâ€™t have espresso, you can make this coffee shake with brewed coffee leftover will work too. Or if you have some instant coffee granules you can use a teaspoon of that and add milk as the base liquid to thin the milkshake out.

Note: Keep in mind that even coffee has health benefits, when combined with ice cream and sugar this will not make it a healthy drink and should be consumed in moderation as an occasional treat.
