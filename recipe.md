Step 1. Prepare the ingredients: for easy-to-scoop ice cream, remove from the freezer 10 minutes before using. For a thicker shake use frozen banana, or if you prefer your milkshake without banana, use ice instead, or just leave it out. And donâ€™t forget to chill your glasses. This will ensure the coffee milkshake stays cold as long as possible.

Step 2. Add ingredients in a blender and blend the milkshake. Start on the lowest speed and work your way up to medium speed, blend until the coffee milkshake is smooth. Pulse a few times as needed to keep things moving.

Step 3. Taste and adjust ingredients as needed, adding more milk, coffee or ice cream for creaminess (see substitutions and add-ins you could use, below in the post).

Step 4. Pour into glasses and enjoy right away.
